This program uses a database to hold information about locations of "pixels" on a field. A queen generates tasks for drones to move the pixels around the field.
Queens and Drones are separate instances of python programs that can be running on the same computer, or separate computers.
Additional tasks and capabilities will be implemented in the future.
